This is a completely contrived example with scripts intended for a
hypothetical "nopkg" pkginfo file for use with Munki. It is intended to
show some of the scripts that can be used in a pkginfo file, and how
their exit status is used by Munki.

This code is provided "as is" with no warranty. Use at your own risk.

Please do not consider this production quality code and do not deploy it
to production systems.

See the slides from the Penn State MacAdmins Conference 2014 talk
entitled "Extending management systems with scripting" for information
on creating the "nopkg" pkginfo with these scripts.
